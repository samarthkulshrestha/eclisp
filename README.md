## Introduction

<img src="assets/xkcd_eclipse.png" align="right" style="margin: 16px;" />

**Eclisp** is a [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LISP) dialect that focuses on minimalism, simplicity, and clarity. Its design decisions are guided by the following mantras:

+ **Need for speed.** Performance is a priority.
+ **Close to metal.** There is less between you and vanilla Lisp by design. That means less to work around when you tinker.
+ **Different is good.** Eclisp occasionally deviates from the original Lisp in favour of building a better, more modern language.
+ **The smaller the better.** With the binary coming in at `121kb`, and only about a thousand lines of code, Eclisp's core is tiny, without compromising on delivering a full-fledged, functional programming language.

## Prerequisites

+ a C compiler (*GNU C Compiler v12.2+ is recommended*)
+ Git v2.23+

## Install

Only GNU/Linux systems are supported.

#### language core

+ clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/samarthkulshrestha/eclisp.git ~/.eclisp
```

+ compile the code
```
cd ~/.eclisp/src
cc -std=c99 -Wall eclisp.c lib/mpc.c -ledit -lm -o eclisp
```

+ make sure the binary is executable
```
chmod +x ./eclisp
```

+ move the binary to somewhere in your shell's $PATH
```
mv ./eclisp ~/.local/bin/
```

#### standard library

+ move the standard library file to library location
```
cd ~/.eclisp/src
sudo cp std.eclp /lib/
```

+ set the environment variable for stdlib's location. add the following line to
  your shell's configuration file (`.bashrc` or `.zshrc`).
```
export ECLISP_ROOT="/lib"
```

## Run

+ running `eclisp` in the terminal launches the interactive prompt
```
eclisp version 1.1.15
author: samarth kulshrestha

eclisp Î»
-> 
```

+ files can be executed by running
```
eclisp <filename.elcp>
```
