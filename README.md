## Introduction
**Eclisp** is a [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LISP) dialect that focuses on minimalism, simplicity, and clarity. Its design decisions are guided by the following mantras:

+ **Need for speed.** Performace is a priority.
+ **Close to metal.** There is less between you vanilla Lisp by design. That means less to work around when you tinker.
+ **Different is good.** Eclisp occasionally deviates from the original Lisp in favour of building a better, more modern language.
+ **The smaller the better.** With the binary coming in at `121kb`, and only about a thousand lines of code, Eclisp's core is tiny, without compromising on delivering full-fleged, functional programming language.
